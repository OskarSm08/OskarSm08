### Hi there 👋, I'm Oskar Smolarek

**`Software Engineer (Problem Solver, Debugger, Precise)`**

I am an avid software engineer who enjoys creating projects and systems, while also identifying bugs and problems within code and precisely fixing them. My interest in software engineering began in high school where I studied computing science and mathematics which were my 2 favourite subjects. The complexity and ever expanding areas within the 2 subjects have pushed me to take up a career in this industry. Currently, I am developing my knowledge and skills in Java, Python and web development and I am always looking for extra skills and challenges.

My coding journey started from a young age, playing games like a kid and was intrigued on how they work and whats going on behind the scenes and wanted to start programming myself. I started with Python in highschool and then web development learning how to make great applications and websites.
